## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a vulnerability you may voluntarily report it to
security@macaroncanary.com with an e-mail that is easily reachable
using the following template as a suggestion:

```
Name (Optional: Pronouns): [Your name, optionally also your pronouns]
GitHub (Optional): [Your GitHub]
Title: [e.g. VULN at LOCATION via METHOD]
Description: [Expand on the title with more details on the vulnerability,
              how the vulnerability occurred]
Reproduce: [Supporting material on how to reproduce including code, tools
            and/or commands used, etc.]
Impact: [Severity here with justification why]
Comments (Optional): [Any recommendations, comments, questions, etc.]
```

All reported vulnerabilities provided in this method will receive a
response, whether accepted or not, within 48 hours. If rejected an
explanation will be provided. If accepted, a draft security advisory will
be opened on GitHub. If you provided a GitHub username in the report it
will be added to the new security advisory where you may further discuss
and/or be involved with the fix to the vulnerability if you wish to.

The Macaron Canary project cannot currently provide monetary compensation
and understand vulnerabilities may be disclosed publicly without prior
notification to the project. However it would be highly appreciated if
there were a few days notice prior to a public disclosure at
security@macaroncanary.com so a fix could be started and/or completed by
the time of the bug(s) made public.
